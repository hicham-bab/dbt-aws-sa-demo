# Quickstart: dbt Platform + Amazon Redshift

Get from zero to a running dbt Mesh on Redshift in under 30 minutes.
Written for both **AWS Solutions Architects** (starting from zero AWS setup) and
**dbt Solutions Architects** (who may already have dbt Cloud but need a fresh Redshift target).

---

## What you'll have at the end

Three connected dbt projects — a full dbt Mesh — all running on Amazon Redshift:

| Project | Directory | What it contains |
|---|---|---|
| **AWS Ecommerce Platform** | `platform/` | 14 models, public contracts, Semantic Layer (5 metrics) |
| **Marketing Analytics** | `marketing/` | 2 models — customer segments, region performance |
| **Finance Analytics** | `finance/` | 3 models — revenue recognition, product P&L, geo P&L |

Cross-project lineage visible in dbt Explorer. Fusion LSP active in Kiro / VS Code / Cursor.

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | AWS SA path | dbt SA path |
|---|---|---|
| AWS account | Any account, free tier OK | Use a sandbox/demo account |
| Amazon Redshift | Create one (Step 1) | Request a shared demo cluster from your team, or create one |
| dbt Cloud account | Sign up free at cloud.getdbt.com | Use your internal account |
| GitHub account | Needed to fork this repo | Same |

---

## Step 1 — Set up Amazon Redshift

> **dbt SA tip:** If your team has a shared Redshift demo environment, skip to Step 2
> and just run `setup/01_redshift_setup.sql` against it.

### Option A — Redshift Serverless (recommended — fastest to spin up)

1. Open the [Amazon Redshift console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshiftv2)
2. If you see a "Try Amazon Redshift Serverless" banner, click it → **Get started**
   - If not: click **Serverless** in the left nav → **Create workgroup**
3. Choose **Use default settings**
   - This creates a workgroup named `default` and a namespace named `default`
4. Under **Credentials**, set an admin username (e.g. `admin`) and a password — **write these down**
5. You'll see a **Permissions** section warning about IAM roles — **skip it**.
   An IAM role is only needed for COPY/UNLOAD from S3. dbt connects with username + password,
   and we load data via `dbt seed` (SQL INSERT, not S3 COPY), so no IAM role is required.
6. Click **Save configuration**
7. Wait ~2 minutes until the workgroup status shows **Available**

**Find your endpoint:**
- Left nav → **Serverless** → **Workgroups** → click `default`
- Under **General information**, find the **Endpoint** field
- It looks like: `default.123456789012.us-east-1.redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com:5439/dev`
- Note it down — you'll need it in Step 4

**Enable public accessibility (required for dbt Cloud):**
- On the workgroup page, click the **Network and security** tab
- Find the **Publicly accessible** row → click **Edit** → toggle to **On** → Save
- Without this, dbt Cloud cannot reach your Serverless endpoint from the internet
- Note: the Actions menu does **not** have this option in the current console — it is only in the Network and security tab

### Option B — Redshift Provisioned Cluster

1. In the Redshift console, click **Create cluster**
2. Choose **Free trial** (dc2.large) or your preferred node type
3. Under **Database configurations**:
   - Database name: `dev`
   - Admin username: `admin`
   - Admin password: set one and write it down
4. Under **Additional configurations** → expand **Network and security**
   - Enable **Publicly accessible**
5. Click **Create cluster** and wait until status shows **Available**

**Find your endpoint:**
- Click your cluster → **General information** → **Endpoint**
- It looks like: `my-cluster.abc123def456.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/dev`

### Allow dbt Cloud to reach Redshift (both options)

dbt Cloud connects to Redshift over the internet. You need to open port 5439 in the security group.

**Step 1 — Find your security group ID:**
- Redshift console → **Serverless** → **Workgroups** → click your workgroup → **Network and security** tab
- Note the security group ID shown under **VPC security groups** (e.g. `sg-defe99c4`)

> The "Edit network and security" page in Redshift only lets you change *which* security group
> is attached — it does not let you edit the rules inside it. You need to go to EC2 for that.

**Step 2 — Edit the rules in EC2:**
1. In the AWS top search bar, search for **EC2** and open it
2. In the EC2 left nav → **Network & Security** → **Security Groups**
3. Paste your security group ID (e.g. `sg-defe99c4`) in the search box → click on it
4. Click the **Inbound rules** tab → **Edit inbound rules** → **Add rule**:
   - Type: `Custom TCP`
   - Port range: `5439`
   - Source: click the **Source** dropdown → select **Anywhere-IPv4**
     — this fills in `0.0.0.0/0` automatically. Do not type an IP manually here.
5. Click **Save rules**

> **For production:** add three separate rules using the specific dbt Cloud IPs
> (shown in the Settings section of the dbt Cloud connection form), each with `/32`:
> `3.123.45.39/32`, `3.126.140.248/32`, `3.72.153.148/32` (EU Frankfurt IPs — yours may differ).
> `/32` is correct — it means "exactly this one IP address". Each IP needs its own rule row.

---

## Step 2 — Create the dbt database user and schemas

Open **Redshift Query Editor v2** (no local client needed):
- Redshift console → **Query editor v2** (left nav)
- Connect to your cluster/workgroup and select database `dev`

Run the full script at `platform/setup/01_redshift_setup.sql`. The key parts are:

```sql
-- Create a dedicated user for dbt (don't use your admin for dbt)
CREATE USER dbt_user PASSWORD '<choose-a-strong-password>';

-- Create all schemas dbt will write to
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS raw;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS staging;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS intermediate;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS marts;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS marketing;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS finance;

-- Grant dbt_user access to all schemas
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA raw          TO dbt_user;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA staging      TO dbt_user;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA intermediate TO dbt_user;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA marts        TO dbt_user;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA marketing    TO dbt_user;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA finance      TO dbt_user;
```

---

## Step 3 — Create a dbt Cloud account and connect your repo

### Create an account
1. Go to [cloud.getdbt.com](https://cloud.getdbt.com) → **Start for free**
2. Sign up with your work email — no credit card required for the free trial
3. When the setup wizard starts, choose **I'll configure my project manually**

### Fork and connect this repo
1. Fork this repo to your GitHub account
2. In dbt Cloud: **Account settings** (gear icon, top right) → **Integrations** → **GitHub**
3. Click **Link** and authorize dbt Cloud to access your GitHub account
4. You'll be redirected back to dbt Cloud — GitHub is now connected

---

## Step 4 — Connect dbt Cloud to Redshift

This step is where most people hit errors. Read carefully.

### Find the correct hostname

The hostname is the **bare domain name only** — no port, no database name, no protocol prefix.

**From your endpoint (which you noted in Step 1), extract just this part:**

| Your full endpoint | What to paste in dbt Cloud |
|---|---|
| `default.123456789012.us-east-1.redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com:5439/dev` | `default.123456789012.us-east-1.redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com` |
| `my-cluster.abc123.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/dev` | `my-cluster.abc123.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com` |

**Rule:** Stop at `.amazonaws.com` — strip everything after it (`:5439/dev`).

> **"Create connection error: The request was invalid"** — this error in dbt Cloud almost always
> means the Host field contains the port (`:5439`) or the database (`/dev`). Strip both.

### Check your dbt Cloud region IPs first

Before filling in the form, note the IPs shown in the Settings section of the connection page —
dbt Cloud displays the exact IPs it will connect from (they vary by your dbt Cloud account region).
Make sure **all three IPs** are allowed on port 5439 in your Redshift security group.

Common IP sets by dbt Cloud region:

| dbt Cloud region | IPs |
|---|---|
| EU (Frankfurt) | `3.123.45.39`, `3.126.140.248`, `3.72.153.148` |
| US (N. Virginia) | See [dbt Cloud IP docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/about-cloud/access-regions-ip-addresses) |

> For a quick demo, allowing `0.0.0.0/0` on port 5439 rules out IP issues entirely.
> Restrict to specific IPs before sharing with customers.

### Pre-flight checklist before opening dbt Cloud

Confirm all three of these are done in AWS before touching the dbt Cloud form — if any are missing the connection will fail:

- [ ] Security group has inbound rules for all dbt Cloud IPs on port 5439
- [ ] Workgroup **Publicly accessible** is **On** (Data access tab → Network and security → Edit)
- [ ] You know your admin username and password from Step 1

### Create the connection in dbt Cloud

1. In your dbt Cloud project: top nav → **Deploy** → **Connections** → **+ New connection**
   - Alternatively: **Account settings** → **Connections** → **+ New connection**
2. Select **Redshift**
3. Fill in the **Settings** section:

| Field | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Connection name | `Redshift Demo` | Any name |
| Server Hostname | `<hostname only — see table above>` | No port, no `/dev` |
| Port | `5439` | Always 5439 for Redshift |
| OAuth method | `--` | Leave as default |

4. Scroll down and click **Optional settings** to expand it:

| Field | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Database** | **`dev`** | **REQUIRED — do not leave blank** |

> **"Create connection error: The request was invalid"** with correct hostname/port means
> the Database field is empty. It is inside Optional settings (collapsed by default)
> but the form will not save without it. Fill in `dev` and try again.

5. Click **Save**

> Username and password are not set on the connection itself — they go in **Credentials**
> under your profile settings after saving. See "Set your personal developer credentials" below.

### Create a development environment

1. **Deploy** → **Environments** → **+ Create environment**
2. Fill in:
   - Name: `Development`
   - Environment type: `Development`
   - Connection: select `Redshift Demo`
3. Click **Save**

### Set your personal developer schema

1. Click your name (top right) → **Profile settings** → **Credentials**
2. Find the project row → click **Edit**
3. Set **Schema**: `dbt_<yourfirstname>` (e.g. `dbt_hicham`)
   — this is your personal dev sandbox, isolated from others
4. Click **Save**

---

## Step 5 — Set up the three Mesh projects

This repo has three independent dbt projects. Each needs its own project in dbt Cloud,
all sharing the same Redshift connection.

### Project 1 — Platform (set this up first)

1. In dbt Cloud: top nav → **Account settings** → **Projects** → **+ New project**
2. Name: `AWS Ecommerce Platform`
3. Repository: select your fork → **Subdirectory**: `platform`
4. Connection: `Redshift Demo`
5. Development schema: `platform_dev`
6. Click **Save**

### Project 2 — Marketing (consumer)

1. **+ New project** → Name: `Marketing Analytics`
2. Same repo → **Subdirectory**: `marketing`
3. Same connection
4. Development schema: `marketing_dev`
5. **Project dependencies**: add `AWS Ecommerce Platform`
   - This tells dbt Cloud how to resolve `ref('aws_ecommerce', 'model_name')` cross-project calls
6. Click **Save**

### Project 3 — Finance (consumer)

1. **+ New project** → Name: `Finance Analytics`
2. Same repo → **Subdirectory**: `finance`
3. Same connection
4. Development schema: `finance_dev`
5. **Project dependencies**: add `AWS Ecommerce Platform`
6. Click **Save**

> **Running locally instead of dbt Cloud?**
> Each project directory has a `profiles.yml.example`. Copy it to `profiles.yml`,
> fill in your Redshift credentials, and run `dbt build` from inside that directory.
> The `platform/` project must be built first.

---

## Step 6 — Load data and build all models

### Open the dbt Cloud IDE for the Platform project

1. In dbt Cloud: switch to the **AWS Ecommerce Platform** project (top nav project picker)
2. Click **Develop** → **Cloud IDE**
3. Wait for the IDE to load and the git status to show "No changes"

### Load the seed data

In the IDE terminal (bottom of the screen), run:

```bash
dbt seed
```

This loads 6 CSV files into the `raw` schema in Redshift:

| Table | Rows | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `raw.raw_customers` | 25 | Customers across AMER / EMEA / APAC |
| `raw.raw_orders` | 125 | Orders Jan 2024 – Mar 2025 |
| `raw.raw_order_items` | 173 | Line items (product × qty × price) |
| `raw.raw_products` | 18 | Cloud product catalog |
| `raw.raw_product_categories` | 6 | Category reference |
| `raw.aws_regions` | 18 | AWS region → geography mapping |

Expected: `Done. PASS=6 WARN=0 ERROR=0`

### Build the platform models

```bash
dbt build
```

Runs in dependency order: seeds → staging (5 views) → intermediate (2 views) → marts (7 tables).
All 7 mart models are built as physical Redshift tables with enforced contracts.

Expected: `Done. PASS=XX WARN=0 ERROR=0 SKIP=0 TOTAL=XX`

### Build the consumer projects

Switch to the **Marketing Analytics** project (project picker, top nav) → open the IDE:

```bash
dbt build
```

Then repeat for **Finance Analytics**.

The consumer models read the platform marts via cross-project `ref()` — dbt Cloud resolves
`ref('aws_ecommerce', 'fct_orders')` to the physical `marts.fct_orders` table in Redshift.

---

## Step 7 — Explore in dbt Cloud

### See the cross-project lineage (the Mesh moment)

1. Top nav → **Explore**
2. Search for `mart_customer_segments` (marketing project)
3. Click **Lineage** tab
4. The graph shows: `marketing.mart_customer_segments` → `aws_ecommerce.fct_customer_lifetime_value`
   → `aws_ecommerce.int_customer_orders` → `aws_ecommerce.stg_orders` → raw source

This is the full Mesh lineage — from S3 (simulated) all the way to a marketing mart,
spanning three separate dbt projects.

### Check the public contract on a platform model

1. In Explore → search for `fct_orders`
2. Click the model → **Details** tab
3. You'll see: `access: public`, `contract: enforced`, all columns with `data_type`
4. Click any consumer project model → its lineage back to `fct_orders` reflects the contract

### Run a failing test (powerful demo moment)

Insert a duplicate customer in Redshift Query Editor v2:
```sql
INSERT INTO raw.raw_customers
  (customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, company, country, aws_region, customer_tier, created_at)
VALUES
  (1, 'Duplicate', 'Customer', 'alice.johnson@techcorp.com', 'Test', 'US', 'us-east-1', 'starter', '2025-01-01');
```

In the dbt Cloud IDE (platform project):
```bash
dbt test --select stg_customers
```

The `unique` test on `customer_id` fails. Clean it up:
```sql
DELETE FROM raw.raw_customers WHERE first_name = 'Duplicate';
```

---

## Step 8 — (Optional) Enable the dbt Semantic Layer

Required for the Bedrock text-to-SQL demo in Scene 4.

1. **Account settings** → **Billing** → confirm you're on Team or Enterprise plan
   (Semantic Layer is not available on the free Developer plan)
2. **Deploy** → **Environments** → open the **Production** environment for the Platform project
3. Under **Semantic Layer**, click **Configure** and note:
   - Host URL
   - Environment ID
   - Service token (create one under **API tokens**)
4. Use these to configure your Bedrock agent or QuickSight connection

Test immediately in the IDE terminal:
```bash
dbt sl query \
  --metrics total_revenue \
  --group-by geography,order_date__month \
  --where "geography = 'EMEA' AND order_date__month BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-03-31'"
```

Expected answer: **$68,299.60** — the exact figure for the Scene 4 Bedrock demo.

---

## Step 9 — (Optional) Set up Fusion LSP in Kiro or VS Code

See [`kiro/lsp-setup.md`](kiro/lsp-setup.md) for the full setup guide.

Short version:
1. Open the `platform/` directory in Kiro, VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf
2. Install the **dbt** extension (publisher: `dbtLabsInc`) from the extensions marketplace
3. The extension downloads the Fusion engine binary automatically on first load
4. Open any `.sql` model file — you'll see autocomplete on `ref()` and `source()`,
   and red squiggles appear within ~2 seconds of a SQL error

---

## Quick reference — dbt commands

```bash
# Run from inside the project directory (platform/, marketing/, or finance/)

# Load CSV seed data into Redshift
dbt seed

# Build everything: models + tests
dbt build

# Build one model and all its upstream dependencies
dbt build --select +fct_customer_lifetime_value

# Run tests only
dbt test

# Compile without hitting the warehouse (Fusion — instant feedback)
dbt compile --select stg_aws_regions

# Query a metric via the Semantic Layer
dbt sl query --metrics total_revenue --group-by geography

# Generate and open docs locally
dbt docs generate && dbt docs serve
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Create connection error: The request was invalid"

There are two separate causes for this error — check both:

**Cause 1: Database field is empty.**
The Database field is inside the **Optional settings** accordion (collapsed by default).
It looks optional but is required — leaving it blank triggers this exact error even if
hostname and port are correct.
- Fix: click **Optional settings** → fill in **Database**: `dev`

**Cause 2: Hostname contains port or database name.**
- Wrong: `my-cluster.abc123.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439`
- Wrong: `my-cluster.abc123.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/dev`
- Wrong: `jdbc:redshift://my-cluster.abc123.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/dev`
- **Correct:** `my-cluster.abc123.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com`

Strip everything after `.amazonaws.com`. Port goes in the Port field. Database goes in Optional settings.

### "Connection timed out" or no response from Test Connection

**Causes and fixes (in order):**
1. Security group not open — verify port 5439 is allowed from `0.0.0.0/0` (or dbt Cloud IPs)
2. Serverless workgroup not publicly accessible — go to workgroup → **Network and security** tab → **Publicly accessible** → Edit → On
3. Workgroup not in Available state — wait and refresh the Redshift console
4. Wrong region — your dbt Cloud account region and Redshift region don't need to match, but confirm the hostname contains the correct region (e.g. `us-east-1`)

### "Authentication failed" or "password authentication failed for user"

- The username or password entered in dbt Cloud doesn't match what you set in Step 2
- Re-run `CREATE USER dbt_user PASSWORD '<password>';` in Query Editor v2 to reset it
- Make sure you're connecting to the `dev` database, not a different one

### "Permission denied" on schema

```sql
-- Run as admin in Query Editor v2
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA raw          TO dbt_user;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA staging      TO dbt_user;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA intermediate TO dbt_user;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA marts        TO dbt_user;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA marketing    TO dbt_user;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA finance      TO dbt_user;
```

### `dbt seed` fails with "relation already exists"

```bash
dbt seed --full-refresh
```

### Consumer models fail with "cross-project ref not found"

- Make sure you ran `dbt build` in the **platform/** project first — the marts must exist before consumers can ref them
- In dbt Cloud: confirm the consumer project has **AWS Ecommerce Platform** listed under **Project dependencies**

### dbt Semantic Layer returns no data

- Semantic Layer requires a **Production** environment with a successful `dbt build` run
- Ensure you're using the correct environment ID and service token from Step 8
